This project scrapes real estate listings (both **sale** and **rent**, for **new** and **old** properties) from [Idealista](https://www.idealista.com), stores the results in CSV files, and provides analysis tools to explore the collected data.

## How It Works

### **1. Scraping**
- **Rent_scraper.py** â†’ Scrapes both **old** and **new** rental properties.
- **Buy_scraper.py** â†’ Scrapes both **old** and **new** properties for sale.
- Both scripts:
  - Use **Selenium** to load pages dynamically.
  - Handle pagination to scrape all available listings.
  - Store extracted data (links, price, area, rooms, etc.) into CSV files.

---

### **2. Analysis**
- **Rent_Analyze.py** â†’ Loads the CSVs generated by `Rent_scraper.py` and performs:
  - Duplicate detection
  - Missing value checks
  - Statistical summaries
- **Buy_Analyze.py** â†’ Same as above but for sale listings.
